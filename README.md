# Compiler SOYUZ

### Running the compiler

To compile and run a file, go to the project directory and type `./soyuz`. Optionally, you can send a file to compile as an argument, otherwise you will be prompted to enter a file:

```bash
./soyuz tests/fibonacci.syz
```

### Documentation

You can find the documentation for the project [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rqFP3Uju7VdvWWRAyn2SSos5WpsXQ0mw), where you will find anything you need to write and run your own programs written in `SOYUZ`.

### Test Programs

Included in the project is a folder `tests/` where you may find some test programs, check them out and modify them. See what breaks.
